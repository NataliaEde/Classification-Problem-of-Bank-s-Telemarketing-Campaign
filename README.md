# Classification problem of Bank's Telemarketing Campaign


### Introduction

Retail banks collect term deposits as part of their core business investment products. Banks generate a profit by lending funds held in deposit accounts for a higher rate than it pays the customer. Therefore, banks emphasize their marketing efforts to attract customers to deposit funds. 

Although most marketing channels are transitioning to a digital form and telemarketing campaigns are fading away, there is still space in advertising to utilize the phone as a tool for remote marketing. While remote marketing is moving gradually into robocalls, prospects still prefer to talk to a human rather than a robot-speaking voice.  

In finance, an individual who buys a term deposit is called a subscriber. Subscription refers to a potential investor signing up for an investment vehicle agreement involving cash flow and money transfer. Different elements, such as a personal financial situation or high-interest rate, which makes the cost of borrowing more appealing, affect the subscription decision of the prospect. As such, banks benefit from data analysis and prediction models to optimize their campaigns by targeting certain segments of individuals. 

### Purpose

Our goal is to build a model to predict if a prospect will subscribe to a term deposit campaign.
